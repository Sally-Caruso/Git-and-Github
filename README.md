## Git & Github

**Git** and **GitHub** are not the same thing neither the same company.

Officially Git is a *version control system*: it's like an epic **save** button for **files and directories**.

A save in Git records differences in files and folders and keeps an *historical record* of each save.<br>
Git enables us to review how a project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past.
Once connected to a network, Git allows you to **push a project to GitHub**.

- **Git** is a very popular **version control system** and it works on your **local** machine
- **GitHub** is a service, a **remote** storage facility on the web that allows you to **upload code using Git** and to manage your code with a nice web interface.<br>

This means that by learning Git, you will get to showcase your portfolio on GitHub!
